Chicago Works For You ([http://www.chicagoworksforyou.com](http://www.chicagoworksforyou.com)) is a citywide dashboard with ward-by-ward views of service delivery in Chicago. 

Technical
---------

The CWFY website ([`frontend/`](frontend/)) runs on Jekyll and Compass. There is a backend API ([`api/`](api/)) written in Go.

See [API.md](doc/API.md) for details on how to use the backend API. See [FRONTEND.md](doc/FRONTEND.md) for information on the public-facing website.

Data
----

The service request data for Chicago Works For You comes from the [City of Chicago Open311 API](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/api).

Chicago Works For You publishes a nightly database snapshot. This is a complete copy of the production database powering [chicagoworksforyou.com](http://chicagoworksforyou.com).

The snapshot file is ~235MB and is in PostgreSQL [pg_dump format](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/interactive/app-pgdump.html).

Download the snapshot: [http://s3.amazonaws.com/cwfy-database-backups/production.dump](http://s3.amazonaws.com/cwfy-database-backups/production.dump)

Instructions for loading into a local PostgreSQL database:

    createdb cwfy
    pg_restore -d cwfy -O -c /path/to/download/production.dump

This assumes that your have PostgreSQL installed and the PostGIS extension installed. If you are using Mac OS X,  [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/) is a very quick and easy way to install both PostgreSQL and PostGIS.
The database schema is available at [db/schema.sql](db/schema.sql).
