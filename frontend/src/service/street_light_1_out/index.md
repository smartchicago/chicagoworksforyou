Per the [City of Chicago](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/311/supp_info/311ServiceTypes.html), this data shows reports of one or two lights out of order (on metal poles) on a street. This is a different service request than if all the lights were out. Whenever [CDOT](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot.html) receives a report of a street light outage, the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in a group (circuit) to make sure that they are working properly. Street light repairs are usually done during the day when the lights are not on.
