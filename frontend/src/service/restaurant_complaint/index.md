Residents can report restuarants with unclean conditions or cases of possible food poisoning through the 311 system. These complaints will result in a food inspector visiting the restaurant and inspecting it for health code violations. Upon completion, these issues will be marked as "Closed - Pass" or "Closed - Failed". Failing a food inspection will usually result in a citation being issued against the restaurant.
