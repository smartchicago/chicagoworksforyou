Per the [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Performance-Metrics-Transportation-Pavement-Cave-i/euee-qccq), as underground drainage systems age, occasionally failures in the pipes and joints can cause pavement cave-ins. The [Department of Transportation (CDOT)](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot.html) responds to pavement cave-ins reported through 311â€™s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system on a case-by-case basis. This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete pavement cave-in repairs per week. The target response time for pavement cave-ins is within 3 days.
