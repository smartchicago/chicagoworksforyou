Per the [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Alley-Lights-Out/t28b-ys7j), this service type is used to report one or more alley lights out. Most city alleys are illuminated with 250 watt lights. Over the past decade the number of these alley lights has increased significantly – from 46,000 in 1989 to more than 67,000 today. According to [an article in the Chicago Tribune](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-06/news/chi-chicago-starts-replacing-lights-that-have-shrouded-city-in-orange-glow-20110806_1_sodium-vapor-new-lights-orange-glow), a program to replace orange-hued sodium vapor lights with new ceramic metal-halide lights began in 2011. About 11,000 lights in 300 miles of alleys throughout the city are to be replaced under this program.

These requests are handled by the [Chicago Department of Transportation.](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot.html). Dark Sky Compliant Light Fixtures, referenced in [this 2010 brochure](http://www.slideshare.net/juggernautco/chicago-green-alley-handbook-2010), is another recent trend in alley lighting in Chicago.
