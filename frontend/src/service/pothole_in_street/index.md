Per the [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Pot-Holes-Reported/7as2-ds3y), the [Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot.html) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago.

CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews. One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block. Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes. On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.

If a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of "Duplicate (Open)". For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of "Duplicate (Open)". Duplicates are not displayed on the Chicago Works for You Site.

Once the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and "Duplicate (Closed)" for any duplicate requests. A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled. If another issue is found with the street, such as a “cave-in” or “failed utility cut”, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor.
