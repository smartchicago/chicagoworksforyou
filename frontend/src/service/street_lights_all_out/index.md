title: Street Lights All / Out
---
Per the [City of Chicago](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/311/supp_info/311ServiceTypes.html), complete blocks of streets lights on metal poles (more than two street lights) that are completely out are reported for repair use this service type. 

The [Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot.html) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. Whenever CDOT receives a report of an “All Out” the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly.
