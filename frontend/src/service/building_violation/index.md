Building violations in this dataset are generated as a result either a 311 complaint, periodic inspection of a building, or generated as a result of a permit registration. Building violations occur when a building is not up to the standards set forth in the [Chicago Building Code](http://www.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Illinois/chicagobuilding/buildingcodeandrelatedexcerptsofthemunic?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:chicagobuilding_il).

_You can view the raw data on the City of Chicago [data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Violations/22u3-xenr)._
