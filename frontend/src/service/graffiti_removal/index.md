Per the [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Graffiti-Removal/hec5-y4x5), The [Department of Streets & Sanitation](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets.html) utilize "Graffiti Blaster"  crews to remove vandalism as a service to private property owners. Graffiti Blasters employ "blast" trucks that use baking soda under high water pressure to erase painted graffiti from brick, stone and other mineral surfaces. They also use paint trucks to cover graffiti on the remaining surfaces. Organizations and residents may report graffiti and request its removal by calling 311.

Often, 311 will receive duplicate requests for the same graffiti. These requests will show in the system as "Open - Dup" or "Completed - Dup" but are not shown on the Chicago Works for You site.
