The [Department of Streets & Sanitation](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets.html) investigates reported rat sightings. Alley conditions are examined. If any damaged carts are identified, Sanitation Ward Offices, which distribute the carts are notified. Rodenticide is placed in rat burrows to eradicate nests.
