## Welcome 

Chicago Works For You is a citywide dashboard with ward-by-ward views of service delivery in Chicago. Here's a look at what you get:

#### Home

The homepage is a citywide map with a daily summary of all service requests submitted, by service type and ward. 

Dark lines under and up-arrows next to a request type means there were more requests of that type on that date than average. The longer the line, the higher above average. Highest above average is highlighted on the map as default. 

Click any service request type to see the raw numbers and averages. The legend in the lake shows you the number ranges for each type in each ward. Click any service type to see those numbers for any day.

Go back and forth in time, it will show numbers for that service request, updating the web address so that you can share any view via Twitter, Facebook, or email.

For advanced users who like to hack URLs, you can type in any date you want, going back to January 1, 2008, the first day for which we have data from the City.

#### Services

Choose any service request type from the Services menu to see weekly views of service delivery by ward.

The bars show all requests opened in each ward, displayed by the day of the week it was opened. Hover over any bar to see exact numbers of opened requests. The check mark is how many requests of that type were closed in each ward.

Click any day to see that service type on a map.

Move backward and forward in time to see the weeks go by.



## Data

#### Where does this data come from?

This data comes directly from the City of Chicago's [Open311 API](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/api). Chicago's Open311 API can be used to both view 311 request data as well as enter new requests directly into the system.

#### Why is this data available?

In 2012, the City of Chicago became a [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/2012-partners/chicago/) partner city. A team of four technologists worked to build an [Open311](http://open311.org/) system for Chicago that would help residents track what was happening with their service requests. Through a grant from [Smart Chicago](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org) the team built Chicago [Service Tracker](http://servicetracker.cityofchicago.org/) which shows each step the city takes to resolve a 311 request. This also enabled all the 311 data to be accessible on the city's data portal.

## Open311

311 is a national standard for requesting city services. While, 911 is for emergencies, 311 system is designed to handle all other calls. 311 is the systems that manages all city services. When a resident makes a request for a city service, this request is entered into the system and given a tracking number.

#### Submit a request to the city

Requests can be made by phone, the city's [website](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/311/supp_info/request_service.html) or through any app that utilizes the city's [Open311 API](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/api).

## Smart Chicago Collaborative

The [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org) is a civic organization devoted to using technology to make lives better in Chicago. We were formed to address the challenge of the lack of broadband Internet access for all Chicagoans. More broadly, we work to apply the transformative power of technology to solve problems for the people of Chicago.

We are a startup that was founded in part by our municipal government and nurtured by some of its most venerable institutions. Our founding partners are the [City of Chicago](http://cityofchicago.org), the [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation](http://macfound.org), and The [Chicago Community Trust](http://cct.org). As a funding collaborative, we help bring together municipal, philanthropic, and corporate investments in civic innovation.

We have a host of current [projects](http://smartchicagoapps.org) and partnerships, and we are actively seeking to connect ideas and resources in all areas of philanthropy in Chicago.
