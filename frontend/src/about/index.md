### Data

#### Where does this data come from?

This data comes directly from the City of Chicago's [data portal](data.cityofchicago.org). Specifically, the Chicago [Open311 API](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/api). 311 is the systems that manages all city services. When a resident makes a request for a city service, this request is entered into the system and given a tracking number. Requests can be made by phone, the city's [website](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/311/supp_info/request_service.html) or through any app that utlizes the city's [Open311 API](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/api)

#### Why is this data available?

In 2011, the City of Chicago became a [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/2012-partners/chicago/) partner city. A team of four technologists worked to build an [Open311](http://open311.org/) system for Chicago that would help residents track what was happening with their service requests. Through a grant from [Smart Chicago](smartchicagocollaborative.org) the team built Chicago [Service Tracker](http://servicetracker.cityofchicago.org/) which shows each step the city takes to resolve a 311 request. This also enabled all the 311 data to be accesssible on the city's data portal.

### Smart Chicago Collaborative

The [Smart Chicago Collaborative](smartchicagocollaborative.org) is a civic organization devoted to using technology to make lives better in Chicago. We were formed to address the challenge of the lack of broadband Internet access for all Chicagoans. More broadly, we work to apply the transformative power of technology to solve problems for the people of Chicago.

We are a startup that was founded in part by our municipal government and nurtured by some of its most venerable institutions. Our founding partners are the [City of Chicago](cityofchicago.org), the [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation](macfound.org), and The [Chicago Community Trust](cct.org). As a funding collaborative, we help bring together municipal, philanthropic, and corporate investments in civic innovation.

We have a host of current [projects](smartchicagoapps.org) and partnerships, and we are actively seeking to connect ideas and resources in all areas of philanthropy in Chicago.
